# Migration Summary: MongoDB/Redis to Appwrite

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to migrate the Micro SaaS Backend from using MongoDB and Redis to using Appwrite as the primary data store and authentication provider.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Appwrite Configuration

- Created `src/config/appwrite.js` to initialize and configure the Appwrite client
- Added environment variables for Appwrite in `.env` and `.env.example`
- Removed MongoDB and Redis connection configurations

### 2. Created Appwrite Services

- Created `src/services/auth.service.js` to handle authentication with Appwrite
- Created `src/services/site.service.js` to handle site operations with Appwrite
- Updated `src/services/log.service.js` to use Appwrite for logging

### 3. Updated Controllers

- Modified `src/controllers/auth.controller.js` to use the new auth service
- Modified `src/controllers/site.controller.js` to use the new site service
- All controllers now use the services layer for database operations

### 4. Updated Middleware

- Modified `src/middlewares/auth.middleware.js` to authenticate using Appwrite
- Removed Redis token storage in favor of JWT verification

### 5. Created Setup Script

- Added `setup-appwrite.js` to initialize Appwrite collections
- Added npm script `setup-appwrite` to run the setup

### 6. Updated Dependencies

- Added `node-appwrite` package
- Removed `mongoose` and `redis` packages

### 7. Updated Documentation

- Created `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` with steps to complete the migration
- Updated `README.md` to reflect the new architecture
- Created this summary document

## Benefits of the Migration

1. **Simplified Infrastructure**: No need to manage separate MongoDB and Redis instances
2. **Reduced Operational Complexity**: Appwrite handles the database infrastructure
3. **Built-in Features**: Appwrite provides additional features that can be leveraged in the future
4. **Scalability**: Appwrite handles scaling the database as the application grows
5. **Reduced Costs**: No need for separate database hosting

## Next Steps

1. Complete the environment configuration by adding the Appwrite Project ID and Database ID
2. Run the setup script to create the collections
3. Migrate any existing data from MongoDB to Appwrite (if needed)
4. Test all API endpoints to ensure they work with the new data layer

## Architecture Changes

Before:
```
Client → Express API → MongoDB/Mongoose → MongoDB Atlas
                     → Redis → Redis Cloud
```

After:
```
Client → Express API → Appwrite Services → Appwrite Cloud
```

The API contract remains the same, so clients will not need to be updated.
